# Udacity-Data-Wrangling

This is a Data Wrangling Project, which is a part of Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity.

Project Overview
You will choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.
Finally, you will choose either MongoDB or SQL as the data schema to complete your project.
